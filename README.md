# FlorAmore
Flower Shop by HTML &amp; CSS

FlorAmore is a fully responsive e-commerce website focused on selling flowers and related services. The website provides a welcoming and visually appealing interface, aimed at engaging customers through an elegant design, vibrant floral imagery, and easy navigation. I have used only HTML and CSS for making this project. For appealing visualization I used icons from Font-Awesome. It provides an eye pleasing design with fully responsive feature.
